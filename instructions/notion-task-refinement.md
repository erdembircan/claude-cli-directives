# Notion Task Refinement

## Purpose

Refine and improve Notion task descriptions to provide better context and enable faster, more accurate AI execution.

## When to Use Task Refinement

- Tasks with vague or incomplete requirements
- Tasks lacking technical specifications  
- Tasks missing acceptance criteria
- Tasks with unclear implementation approach
- Tasks that previously resulted in low confidence ratings
- When user explicitly requests task improvement

## Refinement Workflow

### 1. TASK ASSESSMENT
- Analyze current task for clarity gaps and missing context
- Identify vague requirements or unclear specifications
- Evaluate technical feasibility and implementation complexity
- Check for missing acceptance criteria, dependencies, or success metrics

### 2. COMPLETE PAGE CLEARING
- **CRITICAL**: Use Notion MCP server to delete ALL existing blocks from the page
- Preserve only the page properties (title, status, order, branch, etc.)
- Ensure page content is completely cleared before adding improved version

### 3. IMPROVED CONTENT GENERATION

Create structured, comprehensive task description using this format:

```
# [Task Title]

## Overview
[Clear, concise 2-3 sentence summary of what needs to be accomplished]

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- [Specific, testable requirement 1]
- [Specific, testable requirement 2]

### Technical Requirements
- [Technology stack specifications]
- [Performance requirements]
- [Security considerations]
- [Compatibility requirements]

## Implementation Approach
### Architecture
[High-level architecture decisions and patterns to use]

### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. [Detailed step with specific actions]
2. [Include file names, function names, specific changes]
3. [Cover edge cases and error handling]

### Code Examples/Pseudocode
```language
[Relevant code snippets or pseudocode showing key implementations]
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Specific, testable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Specific, testable outcome 2]
- [ ] [Performance criteria if applicable]
- [ ] [User experience criteria]

## Dependencies
### Technical Dependencies
- [Required libraries, APIs, services]
- [Version requirements]

### Task Dependencies
- [Other tasks that must be completed first]
- [Blocking issues that need resolution]

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] [Unit tests to write]
- [ ] [Integration tests needed]
- [ ] [Manual testing steps]

## Success Metrics
- [Quantifiable measures of success]
- [Performance benchmarks]
- [User satisfaction criteria]

## Risk Assessment
### High Risk
- [Risk description] → [Mitigation strategy]

### Medium Risk  
- [Risk description] → [Mitigation strategy]

## Estimated Effort
**Time Estimate**: [X hours/days]
**Complexity**: [Low/Medium/High]
**Reasoning**: [Explanation of estimate based on scope, dependencies, complexity]

## Additional Context
[Any domain knowledge, business context, or background information needed]
```

### 4. QUALITY VALIDATION
- Ensure all sections are complete and specific
- Verify acceptance criteria are testable and measurable
- Confirm technical approach is feasible and detailed
- Check that dependencies and risks are properly identified

### 5. REFINEMENT COMPLETION
- Update page with improved structured content
- Preserve all original page properties (order, branch, etc.)
- Add comment documenting refinement with timestamp
- Mark original task as refined for tracking purposes

## Refinement Success Criteria

A well-refined task should:
- Have zero ambiguity in requirements
- Include specific technical implementation details
- Provide clear acceptance criteria
- Identify all dependencies and risks
- Enable high-confidence AI execution (>90%)

## Environment Requirements

The Notion MCP server MUST be configured and available for page content manipulation.
