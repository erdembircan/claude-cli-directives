## Usage Instructions

1. **Timing Requirement:** Always use actual Context Engineering implementation time as baseline
2. **Estimation Method:** Base traditional and vibe coding estimates on:
   - Industry experience for similar complexity tasks
   - Consideration of research, debugging, and quality assurance time
   - Account for technical debt in vibe coding approach
3. **Quality Assessment:** Be specific about deliverables and quality differences
4. **Cost Analysis:** Use realistic hourly rates and include hidden costs
5. **Task Specificity:** Tailor metrics and insights to the specific type of development task

## Key Principles

- **Be data-driven:** Use actual implementation results as foundation
- **Include hidden costs:** Especially maintenance and technical debt for vibe coding
- **Emphasize long-term impact:** ROI should consider 6+ month timeframe  
- **Be realistic about trade-offs:** Each approach has appropriate use cases
- **Warn against vibe coding in production:** Make technical debt costs clear

## Quality Standards

- Reports should be comprehensive (2000+ words)
- Include specific metrics and comparisons
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Consider both individual and team productivity
- Account for business impact beyond just development time
