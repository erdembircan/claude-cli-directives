# Commit Instructions - Conventional Commits

## Commit Message Format

Use the following format for all commit messages:

```
[{TYPE}]: {description}
```

## Commit Types

- **FEAT**: A new feature for the user
- **FIX**: A bug fix
- **DOCS**: Documentation only changes
- **STYLE**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **REFACTOR**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **PERF**: A code change that improves performance
- **TEST**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **CHORE**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

## Examples

```
[FEAT]: add user authentication system
[FIX]: resolve login redirect issue
[DOCS]: update API documentation
[STYLE]: fix code formatting
[REFACTOR]: restructure user service
[PERF]: improve database query performance
[TEST]: add unit tests for payment module
[CHORE]: update dependencies
```

## **IMPORTANT**
**DO NOT INCLUDE AI TOOL CREDITS OR CO-AUTHORSHIP ATTRIBUTION IN COMMIT MESSAGES**

## Guidelines

- Use the imperative mood in the description ("add" not "added" or "adds")
- Don't capitalize the first letter of the description
- Capitalize the type (feat, fix, etc.)
- No period at the end of the description
- Keep the description concise (50 characters or less is ideal)
- Explain to the user the "why" behind the change in the body of the commit message both your reasoning behind choosing the type and the description
